# Authentication

## Choosing Authentication

Choose the authentication model that matches where the site will run.

- For sites used inside an OpenAI workspace, prefer the platform-provided authenticated-user headers when the site only needs to know the current OpenAI user.
- For routes that should only be visible after ChatGPT sign-in, use the starter's dispatch-owned SIWC helpers described in [Starter capabilities](starter-capabilities.md) instead of adding app-owned auth.
- For sites that need public sign-in or external identity providers, do not scaffold an app-owned auth stack from a starter. Confirm the current platform auth path before implementation.
- Do not add a full auth stack when the workspace-authenticated user header is sufficient for the product.

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require authenticated access: browser visitors sign in, while non-user API callers use a [platform service credential](#service-access). Public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Email and name are intended for display or contact purposes.

For SIWC-authenticated workspace sites, the dispatcher may also forward the current user's non-empty SIWC `name` claim as `oai-authenticated-user-full-name`. That value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is sent with an `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding` header set to `percent-encoded-utf-8`. Treat the full name as optional, decode it only when the encoding header matches, and do not depend on name-split headers.

## Service access

Private Sites can also support non-user API access. If `get_site` returns `siwc_bypass_bearer_token`, send it only to that Site as `OAI-Sites-Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Dispatch checks and consumes this credential. It does not supply a signed-in user identity or visitor consent to access their connected apps. A shared update endpoint on a Site confirmed to be owner-private can rely on that platform access boundary. Preserve additional authorization wherever the product requires a user identity or narrower permissions. Verify source access separately from access to the Site; never substitute this token for the user context required by a connected source.

Public requests can reach the app without signing in, so public write endpoints need their own authorization. Preserve the requested audience and existing authorization.

Some tool surfaces omit the service credential. Inspect supported connection options before declaring unattended access unavailable. Do not create or rotate credentials just for this check. Keep credentials out of source, browser code, schedule prompts, and user-facing output. Verify that the scheduled task can obtain supported access without the authoring session.

## Adding Authentication

Use this flow when the site needs sign-in-gated or identity-aware behavior.

1. Decide which auth model the product needs:
   - use dispatch-owned SIWC for browser routes that should only be visible after ChatGPT sign-in. This works whether the route needs the forwarded user information or only needs an authenticated viewer.
   - do not add SIWC just because a site is public or published. Add it only when the requested product has a concrete sign-in-gated surface.
   - use the workspace-authenticated user header directly only when no route needs to initiate sign-in.
   - keep authorization decisions in server-side code for every site.
   - do not add app-owned public sign-in or external OAuth from a starter; confirm the current platform auth path before implementation.
2. For dispatch-owned SIWC routes:
   - treat SIWC as authentication, not workspace authorization. A successful sign-in identifies a ChatGPT user but does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce an explicit server-side membership or allowlist check when a route must exclude non-members.
   - for new sites, follow [Starter capabilities](starter-capabilities.md) to obtain the auth helpers, then import them from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts`.
   - use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI, such as rendering a "Sign in with ChatGPT" button for anonymous users and account details for signed-in users.
   - call `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` only in server-rendered browser page flows that should redirect to `/signin-with-chatgpt`.
   - in a Server Component, start browser sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
   - do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
   - never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The Sites dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
   - do not implement app routes for `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, or `/callback`; dispatch owns those paths.
   - keep `returnTo` to same-origin relative paths such as `/profile` or `/notes/123?tab=activity`.
   - mark protected pages `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.
   - when a protected page needs path or query parameters in `returnTo`, compute `returnTo` in the page component and call `requireChatGPTUser` from a nested async server component. This avoids Vinext page-probe redirects before the real search params are available.
   - use `/signout-with-chatgpt?return_to=...` for browser sign-out links.
   - for API routes or server actions that require identity, check `getChatGPTUser()` server-side and reject missing identity instead of trusting client-side affordances.
3. For workspace-authenticated sites:
   - read `oai-authenticated-user-id` when a feature needs a stable user key.
   - read `oai-authenticated-user-email` for display or contact purposes.
   - read and decode `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` only when a display name improves the product, and always fall back to email because the full name header may be absent.
4. Add sign-in-gated product flows only where the site actually needs protected visibility or identity-aware behavior.

Common SIWC fits include pages or endpoints that should not be visible to anonymous visitors, account/profile pages, user-specific dashboards, saved/user-owned records, write actions that should be attributed to the current ChatGPT user, and explicit "sign in to continue" flows. Do not use SIWC for public landing pages, static content, read-only public data, or device-local UI preferences.
