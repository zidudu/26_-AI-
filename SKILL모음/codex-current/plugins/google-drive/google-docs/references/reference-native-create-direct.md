# Native Create Direct

When to read: for blank or basic new Google Docs that can be created directly with native Google Drive and Docs connector APIs.

Do not use blank creation to rebuild a supplied Google Doc template/reference. Resolve that task through `reference-template-preservation-and-edit-scope.md` and use a native copy unless the user explicitly requests selective reference use and no selected native structure must carry forward.

## Decision Boundary

Use connector-native creation when no supplied Google Doc template/reference constrains the output, or when the user explicitly requests selective reference use and no selected native structure must carry forward, and the request can be satisfied by Google Docs primitives with no meaningful quality loss:

- blank Google Doc
- basic text document
- simple title, headings, and paragraphs
- bullet, numbered, or checklist-style lists
- simple links
- simple tables
- supported smart chips such as dates, people, and rich links
- lightweight docs where native Google Docs default styling is acceptable

Only when no supplied Google Doc template/reference constrains the output, use DOCX-first creation instead when the user asks for a polished or complex deliverable:

- polished report, brief, proposal, whitepaper, handout, or formal artifact
- complex visual hierarchy, branding, or custom design system
- cover pages, headers, footers, page breaks, page-level layout, or export-quality pagination
- figures, diagrams, screenshots, or image placement where rendered layout matters
- complex tables or long multi-section documents where document-authoring tooling gives better control
- explicit `.docx`, Word compatibility, PDF-style QA, or high-fidelity export requirements

If the request is ambiguous and a Google Doc template/reference is present, return to the native copy/adaptation route. Otherwise, prefer connector-native creation for normal Google Docs and DOCX-first creation for deliverables that sound designed, branded, or layout-sensitive.

## Blank Doc Flow

For a blank Google Doc, do not invoke the Documents plugin or create a local `.docx`.

Call:

```json
{
  "title": "Desired title",
  "mime_type": "application/vnd.google-apps.document"
}
```

using `mcp__codex_apps__google_drive._create_file`.

If the create response includes the document id or URL, return that. Do not perform a follow-up `_get_document` unless the response lacks enough information to identify the created doc or the user asked for content/metadata verification.

## Basic Content Flow

For a new basic document with content:

1. Create the native Google Doc with `mcp__codex_apps__google_drive._create_file`.
2. Read the new document once with `mcp__codex_apps__google_drive._get_document` to get document id, `revisionId`, body indexes, and `tabId` if present.
3. Compose direct `mcp__codex_apps__google_drive._batch_update_document` requests from connector readback.
4. Use `insertText` for the content skeleton, then apply `updateParagraphStyle`, `updateTextStyle`, `createParagraphBullets`, table requests, links, or supported smart-chip inserts as needed.
5. Re-read once after the write to verify content, headings, lists, links, tables, and supported chips.
6. Do not export HTML or PDF for a basic native doc unless the user explicitly asks for export or the request becomes layout-sensitive.

For a brand-new blank document, the first insertable body index is commonly `1`, but prefer the single `_get_document` read before writing content so tab and revision state come from connector data instead of assumptions.

## Style Guidance

- Use native Google Docs defaults unless the user requested styling.
- Use real paragraph styles for document structure, such as `TITLE`, `HEADING_1`, `HEADING_2`, and `NORMAL_TEXT`.
- Use real Docs lists through `createParagraphBullets`; do not type bullet characters as plain text when a real list is intended.
- Keep styling conservative: black text, normal Google Docs fonts, simple headings, and readable spacing.
- Do not add branded colors, callouts, decorative tables, page chrome, or imported-document polish unless the user asked for that level of artifact.

## Verification

For blank docs, the create response is sufficient when it identifies the new native Google Doc.

For basic docs with content, connector readback must prove:

1. the created file is a native Google Doc
2. requested content is present in the intended order
3. headings, bullets, numbering, links, tables, and supported chips are connector-visible where requested
4. no placeholder text or unintended empty list items remain

If connector-native creation starts requiring complex recovery, rendered visual QA, or large style normalization, stop and reassess whether the task has crossed the boundary into DOCX-first creation.
