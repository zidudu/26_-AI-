# Response And List Format

When to read: any task that writes answer content, takeaways, risks, or supporting points.

## One-Idea-Per-Bullet Contract

1. Each bullet must contain one idea.
2. Split compound points into separate bullets.
3. Keep bullet phrasing concise and parallel.

## List Behavior

1. Use real Docs list paragraphs (no typed bullet characters, no fake numbering).
2. Use numbered lists for ranked, sequential, or numeric content.
3. Use regular bullets for supporting takeaways, risks, dependencies, and short evidence notes.
4. Keep list items concise and parallel.
5. Do not convert alternating label-and-response sections into lists unless the template already presents that section as a list.
6. If source material contains bullets, decide whether the destination section is truly a list before preserving them. Slide bullets often need to become plain paragraphs in docs.
7. If a section is not supposed to be a list, remove both real list formatting and any literal bullet glyphs carried over from source material.
8. When normalizing a label-and-body section out of list form, remove list formatting from the label paragraphs too, not only the inserted answer paragraphs.
9. Never leave an empty list paragraph behind after deleting or rewriting content unless the template or Meeting notes UI shape intentionally requires that placeholder. Clean up unintended dangling bullets explicitly.

## Native Lists Inside Table Cells

Use this workflow only when creating or repairing an actual list inside a table cell:

1. Read the table with `get_tables` and resolve the exact row, column, cell, and item paragraphs. Use full `get_document` when list metadata is not exposed by the table read.
2. Insert item text without literal bullets, dashes used as bullets, or typed number prefixes.
3. Re-read final paragraph ranges after insertion.
4. Apply `createParagraphBullets` only to complete intended item paragraphs, using the peer list behavior when one exists.
5. Exclude cell labels, prompt paragraphs, neighboring content, and the terminal empty cell paragraph.
6. Verify the cell coordinates, connector-visible list metadata, nesting, and absence of typed marker substitutes.

A visible `•`, `-`, or `1.` prefix is not proof of a native list.

## Spacing And Native Formatting

1. Do not add blank paragraphs solely for visual spacing. Use paragraph style, table structure, or section structure instead.
2. Do not leave inserted content unformatted unless the user explicitly asks for plain text.
3. Preserve existing headings, paragraph styles, links, dates, and table structure unless the user asks to change them.
