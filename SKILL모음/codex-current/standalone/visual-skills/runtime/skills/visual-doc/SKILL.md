# Visual Doc

Turn a spec/plan into a single self-contained, hand-drawn-styled HTML document by authoring
a typed block array and rendering it. Unlike the recap (which is automatic), you compose the
blocks — so ground every reference in the real repo.

**Tool location** (resolved through the installer's `~/.claude/visual-skills` symlink — re-run `npm run skills:install` if the repo moves):

    VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR="${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/visual-skills"

**Required language guide.** Before writing user-facing text, read
`$VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR/skills/shared/plain-language.md`. Apply it to every authored field and live
reply.

## Steps

1. **Read the source** spec/plan (the file the user names, or the plan already in context).
2. **Read the authoritative schema:** `$VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR/src/blocks.ts`. It defines the
   `Block` union — treat it as the source of truth for field names and shapes.
3. **Ground it in the real repo:** use real file paths and real identifiers from the target
   codebase (e.g. model names, route/procedure names, exported symbols). Do not invent
   identifiers.
4. **Author a `Block[]` JSON array** using the mapping below.
5. **Render it** from the tool directory:

       cd "$VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR"
       npx tsx bin/doc.ts --blocks <ABSOLUTE_BLOCKS_JSON> --title "<Title>" \
         --source "<source path or label>" --out <ABSOLUTE_OUT_DIR>

   `--out` is a *directory* (e.g. `<repo>/.visual/docs/<label>`, absolute path); the HTML
   (`doc.html`) and any `.excalidraw` sidecars are written together inside it. Diagrams render as
   static D2 by default and stay that way unless you opt in: pass `--excalidraw` to promote
   editable-eligible diagrams to `.excalidraw` scenes (requires the `npm run setup:excalidraw`
   toolchain). Without the flag — or with `--no-excalidraw` — you get the static D2 floor.

6. **Open it:** `open <ABSOLUTE_OUT_DIR>/doc.html` (macOS), else report the path.

## Content -> block mapping

For diagram selection (which structural / boundary / data-flow / behavioral diagram to use) and
compile-tested recipes, consult the shared catalog: `$VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR/skills/shared/diagrams.md`.

Color diagrams with the catalog's semantic palette (the "Color vocabulary" section) — mark the
`changed`/subject node and tag actors / external systems / datastores by role.

Primary blocks you author for a doc:

- **narrative / sections -> `prose`** (Markdown; GitHub-flavored). A fenced `mermaid`
  flowchart inside prose is auto-promoted to a diagram (and becomes editable if the
  Excalidraw upgrade is installed).

      { "type": "prose", "id": "overview", "markdown": "## Overview\n\nWhat & why..." }

- **architecture / flow -> `diagram`** — `d2` is required (the rendering floor); add
  `mermaid` for the editable upgrade on `flowchart`/`architecture` kinds. Quote any d2
  key/value containing a dot or space.

      { "type": "diagram", "id": "flow", "title": "Request flow", "kind": "flowchart",
        "d2": "direction: down\n\"client\" -> \"api\" -> \"db\"",
        "mermaid": "graph TD\nclient-->api-->db" }

- **affected / new files -> `file-tree`** — `status` is one of `A`/`M`/`D`/`R`.

      { "type": "file-tree", "id": "files", "title": "Files", "files": [
        { "path": "src/server/routers/league.ts", "status": "M", "added": 20, "deleted": 4 } ] }

- **key code to explain -> `annotated-code`** — per-line notes; use for the 2-3 most
  important snippets, not everything. `line` is 1-based.

      { "type": "annotated-code", "id": "capture", "title": "captureOrder", "lang": "ts",
        "code": "const order = await paypal.capture(id);\nreturn order;",
        "annotations": [ { "line": 1, "note": "server-side capture" } ] }

- **open decisions -> `questions`**

      { "type": "questions", "id": "open", "title": "Open questions", "questions": [
        { "question": "Refund window?", "recommendedDefault": "30 days" } ] }

- **grouping -> `group`** — a titled, collapsible set of related blocks; add an optional `description`
  (markdown) summarizing what the group covers. Shape: `{ "type":"group", "id":"…", "title":"…", "blocks":[ … ] }` (one level deep). Used mainly by recaps to order diffs into a
  narrative; available for any doc too.

- **multiple views of one thing -> `tabs`** — a CSS-only tab switcher (no JS) presenting
  complementary diagrams as switchable panels. Each tab holds ONE block, one level deep (a tab
  may not contain a `group` or another `tabs`).

      { "type": "tabs", "id": "views", "title": "Two views", "tabs": [
        { "label": "Flow", "block": { "type": "diagram", "id": "v-flow", "title": "Flow", "kind": "flowchart", "d2": "a -> b" } },
        { "label": "Seq",  "block": { "type": "diagram", "id": "v-seq", "title": "Seq", "kind": "sequence", "d2": "shape: sequence_diagram\na -> b: hi" } } ] }

- **lead summary -> `overview`** — a scannable callout placed first: a one-line `headline`, short
  `points` (each `href` linking to a section by `#id`), and an optional lead `diagram`
  (`DiagramBlock` or `tabs`) rendered before the points. Author it for larger docs.

      { "type": "overview", "id": "overview", "headline": "Add PayPal capture",
        "points": [ { "text": "new `capture` [route](#flow)" } ],
        "diagram": { "type": "diagram", "id": "ov-flow", "title": "Flow", "kind": "flowchart", "d2": "a -> b" } }

- **worked instance -> `example`** — a real input walked through stages to its output (`source` +
  `lesson` required; static rail by default, `"reveal"`/`"step"` for volume, `variant:"contrast"`
  for old-vs-new). See `skills/shared/spec-components.md` for the full recipe.

      { "type": "example", "id": "ex-capture", "title": "Capturing an authorized order",
        "source": "test/fixtures/orders/authorized.json",
        "stages": [
          { "label": "Input", "kind": "input", "body": "…" },
          { "label": "Output", "kind": "output", "body": "…" } ],
        "lesson": "Capture is idempotent — replaying it twice charges once." }

**When to add an example:** any transformation or algorithm the doc explains gets one worked
instance — don't just describe the mechanism in prose, show one real case going through it.

Other block types in the `Block` union — `schema`, `api`, `diff` — are normally produced
automatically by the **visual-recap** flow from a real git diff, not hand-authored. Reach
for visual-recap when the subject is a code change rather than a plan.

## Notes

- Block `id`s must be unique across the document.
- Keep d2 valid: quote keys/values with dots (e.g. `"league.captureOrder"`). If d2 fails to
  compile, that block renders a visible placeholder rather than breaking the document.
- Diagrams need `d2` on PATH (`brew install d2`); without it they show placeholders.

## Example

    cd "$VISUAL_SKILLS_DIR"
    npx tsx bin/doc.ts --blocks /tmp/doc-blocks.json --title "Payments migration" \
      --source docs/specs/payments.md --out /Users/me/Projects/app/.visual/docs/payments
    open /Users/me/Projects/app/.visual/docs/payments/doc.html
